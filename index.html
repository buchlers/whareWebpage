            <h1>Pou Manu</h1>
            <p>Some very specific features in the artwork are the pou and the presence of manu (birds) similar to the Manukarere pou erected at Taylors Mistake in the Whitianga CBD. A rhythmic song, called ‘Hetītī, e rere’. In the patere we learn of landmarks, people and storiesfeatured in kōrero shared by local iwi Ngāti Hei. The flight of a tītī, a muttonbird, takes us around some of the important landmarks and geography of the area, an aural map, Māori learning style. In the patere ‘He tītī e rere’, our avian guide begins its flight presiding over Ohinau Island before diving into the waters of Te Whanganui-o-Hei and over to Tāhanga, the maunga at Ōpito. This is the mountain where the famous basalt is found, which was a significant economic commodity for local hapu and iwi. Adzes fashioned at Ōpito were traded with others all over the country. See, you’re learning already! Circling back over the sands of Wharekaho, to Ohuka ’Brophy’s Beach’,on to Taputapuātea ‘Mother Brown’s creek’ and on up the estuary,Whangamaroro – maroro is the flying fish. This patere forms the basis of what James has translated visually onto the whare.</p>

            <h1>Waharoa</h1>
            <p>Carved gateway in the middle of the pou manu at the front.  It represents coming through the entrance way, the threshold, taking a new step into your education. As a seed, growing, and then through your ascent up the poutama of education, you will take flight.” There is a pattern called kape rua,representing seeds, all over the whole waharoa. “It is a pattern mainly associated with Ngāti Porou, but the symbolism was fitting, the seeds of potentiality.”</p>
